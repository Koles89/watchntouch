This is essentially a horrible hacky solution to the fact that CIFS mounts cannot forward file-system event to inotify on linux. This in turn makes it so any number of "on-demand" compilers stop working when applied to mounted shares (among other things).

The idea is to use the watchdog library to monitor a given directory using shitty-old polling, and then poke at the local filesystem so that inotify (and hopefully your apps/tools) pick up the changes. It is almost certainly a very bad idea to run this on a large file structure and/or over a slow network.

With that in mind, simply run `watchntouch` in the directory you'd like to watch, or see `watchntouch -h` for more options.

Installation should be available via `pip install watchntouch`.

Good luck!
